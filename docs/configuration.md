# Device service configuration options

The device service configuration is held in TOML format. By default the SDK will load configuration from a file named `configuration.toml` in the `res` directory, but this may be changed using the --confdir, --file and --profile options.

Configuration parameters are organized within a number of sections. A section is represented by a TOML table, eg `[Service]`.

If the Registry is in use, configuration is contained in subfolders of `edgex/core/1.0/<service-name>`. The "Clients" section is not present in this scenario, as the Registry provides a specific mechanism for maintaining service information.

When a device service is run for the first time with Registry enabled, it reads its configuration from a TOML file and uploads it to the Registry.

The value of any configuration element can be over-ridden with a value from a corresponding environment variable. The service first looks for an environment variable whose name is of the form

`<service-name>_<section-name>_<config-element>`

and if that is not present, then tries

`<section-name>_<config-element>`

For example, `device-template_Device_MaxCmdOps` or `Logging_LogLevel`.

## Service section

Option | Type | Notes
:--- | :--- | :---
Host | String | This is the hostname to use when the service generates URLs pointing to itself. It must be resolvable by other services in the EdgeX deployment.
Port | Int | Port on which to accept the device service's REST API. The assigned port for experimental / in-development device services is 49999.
Timeout | Int | Time (in milliseconds) to wait between attempts to contact core-data and core-metadata when starting up.
ConnectRetries | Int | Number of times to attempt to contact core-data and core-metadata when starting up.
StartupMsg | String | Message to log on successful startup.
CheckInterval | String | The checking interval to request if registering with Consul
ServerBindAddr | String | The interface on which the service's REST server should listen. By default the server listens on all available interfaces.

## Clients section

Defines the endpoints for other microservices in an EdgeX system.

### Data

Option | Type | Notes
:--- | :--- | :---
Host | String | Hostname on which to contact the core-data service.
Port | Int | Port on which to contact the core-data service.

### Metadata

Option | Type | Notes
:--- | :--- | :---
Host | String | Hostname on which to contact the core-metadata service.
Port | Int | Port on which to contact the core-metadata service.

## Device section

Option | Type | Notes
:--- | :--- | :---
DataTransform | Bool | For enabling/disabling transformations on data between the device and EdgeX. Defaults to true (enabled).
Discovery/Enabled | Bool | For enabling/disabling device discovery. Defaults to true (enabled).
Discovery/Interval | Int | Time between automatic discovery runs, in seconds. Defaults to zero (do not run discovery automatically).
MaxCmdOps | Int | Defines the maximum number of resource operations that can be sent to the driver in a single command.
MaxCmdResultLen | Int | Not implemented. Maximum string length for command results returned from the driver.
ProfilesDir | String | A directory which the service will scan at startup for Device Profile definitions in `.yaml` files. Any such profiles which do not already exist in EdgeX will be uploaded to core-metadata.
UpdateLastConnected | Bool | If true, update the LastConnected attribute of a device whenever it is successfully accessed. Defaults to false.
EventQLength | Int | Sets the maximum number of events to be queued for transmission to core-data before blocking. Zero (default) results in no limit.

## Logging section

Option | Type | Notes
:--- | :--- | :---
LogLevel | String | Sets the logging level. Available settings in order of increasing severity are: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR.

## Driver section

This section is for driver-specific options. Any configuration specified here will be passed to the driver implementation during initialization.
